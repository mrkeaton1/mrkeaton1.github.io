### Hi! My name is Matthew Keaton.

I have a deep passion for learning about -- and one day, improving our understanding of -- the mechanisms that give rise to that strange, continuous experience which allows for us to do everything, including reading the Markdown letters appearing on the glowing screen in front of you. As a scientist, that mainly directs me into the lanes of neuroscience and machine learning.
 
Currently, I am a computer science master's student researching computer vision -- more specifically, fine-grained visual categorization as well as domain adaptation for instance segmentation on 2D and 3D cellular data. In addition to my dual Bachelor's of Science degrees in computer science and computer engineering, I obtained minors in mathematics and physics during my undergraduate career. Questions that take a swing at the most fundamental parts of this life are what I'm all about!

If you landed on this website to learn about me as a candidate for a professional opportunity, please take a look at my Publications and Resume page. If you alternatively just wanted to hear/see more behind the scenes of a random internet person's personal interests (including some fun pictures of me doing the things I love), the Gallery page might be right for you. Links to my Github, Google Scholar, LinkedIn, and email address should also be easy enough to find.

Finally, I plan to start a blog series, likely including interesting content/papers I read regarding neuroscience, machine learning, and possibly some other things I like including physics or engineering papers. Stay tuned, and enjoy your stay!
