Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Matthew Keaton. <!--more-->

As you may or may not have noticed, the webpage you are currently visiting is my first ever blog post --- if you 
haven't yet, please have a look at the "About" page linked above for a proper self introduction and guide to 
this website.

Ok, welcome back! Now that you know my background and interests, let me explain the intentions of this blog series 
and some details on what I would like to cover.

The chief purpose of this blog is for self development. As I prepare myself for a PhD and career in 
computational neuroscience, I feel it will be valuable to get a head start on learning important, foundational 
concepts related to the budding field of computational neuroscience and neuroscience more broadly. I also would like 
to fine-tune my capabilities to speak (and write) publicly on difficult yet important topics in research, as I have a 
personal aspiration to one day communicate --- sometimes advocating for and, likely, sometimes warning against --- 
breakthroughs in the areas of neuroscience and machine learning, as both continue to increase their impact on the 
public and common good. Both my knowledge of neuroscience and ability to convey technical details, while I have already 
garnered a solid base through various means, are things I believe I will further sharpen during my graduate education 
and beyond. However, while I have the time to focus my efforts with a higher level of freedom, I have decided to 
begin to move the needle in a manner that is unique and motivating in a number of ways.

In pursuit of both of these goals, I aim to present a cogent, easy to understand set of 
articles which, following the constraints I have set for myself, will hopefully be both engaging and informative. I 
intend to publish approximately every two weeks over the course of the final semester of my master's degree (which 
begins today), meaning that there will be seven articles by the end of this series. I am very excited to start 
working on this project, and I hope that you will come away with something from each of these posts as well.
